                <p>Made in Game Maker Studio 2 using the GML Code language, Axion resembles classic<br>
                    Shoot 'em Ups with it's gameplay and difficulty. I developed the game alone,<br>
                    and all the assets were made by me. My favorite part of it is the destruction<br> system, wherein
                    explosions generated by destroyed enemies can damage the terrain as well as other nearby enemies.</p>

                <p>Made in Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints, Tower Defender is a Tower Defense game where<br>
                players can purchase and upgrade towers to defeat incoming waves of enemies, including powerfull bosses. <br>
                I developed the game alone, using free assets from the UE5 marketplace and Mixamo. spent a lot of time with<br>
                the tower placement and selections system, ensuring that towers maintain spacing<br>
                between them with color coding to let the player know where they can be placed and when they are selected.<br>
                I also spent lots of time balancing the game, perfecting several variables so that you recieve just enough money at just the<br>
                right intervals so that you can contine to buy and upgrade the towers you need without becoming too powerful or too weak.</p>

                <p>Made in Game Maker Studio 2 using the GML Code language, Animal Attack resembles classic arcade games<br>
                    where the player tries to last as long as possible against increasing numbers of enemies to get a high score.<br>
                    This was the first game i've ever made. I developed it alone and all the assets were made by me. My favorite <br>
                    part of it is the air combo system where you recieve a score multiplier that is refreshed every time they hit <br>
                    the ground or every time the destroy an enemy, allowing them to easily stay in the air as long as they keep laning on enemies.
