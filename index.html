                    <p>My name is Elliot Dziemiela and I am a student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Engineering. I have 
                        a passion for video game development and have been making games since I was in middle school. The frameworks I have the most
                        experience in are UE5 Blueprints and GameMaker GML Code. I am well versed in C++, C, and some Python.
                        I also have a web development skills. My experience is with fullstack development in HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, React, 
                        and with RESTful Apis (using and creating). Below I showcase some projects I am the most proud of.

                <p>Made in Game Maker Studio 2 using the GML Code language, Axion resembles classic<br>
                    Shoot 'em Ups with it's gameplay and difficulty. I developed the game alone,<br>
                    and all the assets were made by me. My favorite part of it is the destruction<br> system, wherein
                    explosions generated by destroyed enemies can damage the terrain as well as other nearby enemies.</p>

                <p> <a href="https://mediaspace.illinois.edu/media/t/1_3bls85j3">Video.</a> Made using React, Express, and Axios, Dine Align is a website that allows users to create diet calendars and share them with eachother. It has
                    a search feature, a calendar editor, profile feature, and a daily diet tracker that parses through your current calendar to get the day 
                    corresponding to the current day of the week. This was made by a team of 4 including myself. I was tasked with developing the frontend,
                    mainly using HTML, CSS, and React. I also wrote the Restful Api calls to our backend using Axios.

                <p>Made in Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints, Tower Defender is a Tower Defense game where
                players can purchase and upgrade towers to defeat incoming waves of enemies, including powerfull bosses.
                I developed the game alone, using free assets from the UE5 marketplace and Mixamo. spent a lot of time with
                the tower placement and selections system, ensuring that towers maintain spacing
                between them with color coding to let the player know where they can be placed and when they are selected.
                I also spent lots of time balancing the game, perfecting several variables so that you recieve just enough money at just the
                right intervals so that you can contine to buy and upgrade the towers you need without becoming too powerful or too weak.</p>

                <p>Made in Game Maker Studio 2 using the GML Code language, Animal Attack resembles classic arcade games<br>
                    where the player tries to last as long as possible against increasing numbers of enemies to get a high score.<br>
                    This was the first game i've ever made. I developed it alone and all the assets were made by me. My favorite <br>
                    part of it is the air combo system where you recieve a score multiplier that is refreshed every time they hit <br>
                    the ground or every time the destroy an enemy, allowing them to easily stay in the air as long as they keep laning on enemies.
